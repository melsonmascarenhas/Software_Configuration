Step 1: Update System Packages

sudo apt update

Step 2: Install vsftpd Server on Ubuntu

sudo apt install vsftpd

To launch the service and enable it at startup, run the commands:

sudo systemctl start vsftpd

sudo systemctl enable vsftpd

Step 3: Backup Configuration Files

1. Create a backup copy of the default configuration file by entering the following:

sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf  /etc/vsftpd.conf_default

Step 4: Create FTP User

Create a new FTP user with the following commands:

sudo useradd -m testuser

sudo passwd testuser

Step 6: Connect to Ubuntu FTP Server

Connect to the FTP server with the following command:

sudo ftp ubuntu-ftp

Configuring and Securing Ubuntu vsftpd Server
Change Default Directory

By default, the FTP server uses the /srv/ftp directory as the default directory. You can change this by creating a new directory and changing the FTP user home directory.

To change the FTP home directory, enter the following:

sudo mkdir /srv/ftp/new_location

sudo usermod -d /srv/ftp/new_location ftp

Restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:
Authenticate FTP Users

If you want to let authenticated users upload files, edit the vsftpd.conf file by entering the following:

sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

Find the entry labeled write_enable=NO, and change the value to “YES.”
Save the file, exit, then restart the FTP service with the following:

sudo systemctl restart vsftpd.service

sudo systemctl restart vsftpd.service

Now, you can put any files you want to share via FTP into the /srv/ftp folder (if you left it as the default), or the /srv/ftp/new_location/ directory (if you changed it).
Securing FTP

Numerous exploits take advantage of unsecured FTP servers. In response, there are several configuration options in vsftpd.conf that can help secure your FTP server.
Limit User Access

One method is to limit users to their home directory. Open vsftpd.conf in an editor and uncomment the following command:

chroot_local_user=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
local_root=/srv/ftp/image   # FTP folder
Create a User List File

To create a list file, edit /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list, and add one user per line.

Instruct your FTP server to limit this list of users to their own home directories by editing vsftpd.conf:

chroot_local_user=YES

chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
